# Big Data Meetup

## How I found it
I went to a big data meetup on Jan 25. It was hosted at WeWork SF.
I got the information from meetup.com. 

## Who did I meet
I met a number of people there. Rachel Wolfson was the event host. She was very kind.
I met Daniel Shwartz who is a lead UX designer at 6Sense, Mingyan Hu who is a data scientist at Drawbridge.
I really loved Mingyan's work on digital identities and had a detailed discussion with him mostly on privacy.
I also met Sophian. I am forgetting his company. He works in finance and speaks french. There were many other french guys there too.

Interestingly, I met two springboard mentors there as well Gene Peters and Lewis King. 
I also met Yessi, who is a business strategist from NY.

I will be contacting some of the people I met via email and in person as well. 

Overall it was fun and a great way to make new connections.
